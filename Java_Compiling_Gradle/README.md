# Assignment 2
This assignment will acquaint you with the Gradle build tool. Gradle is a type of program called a “build system” which 
helps developers build large programs out of many source code files. Gradle is a powerful tool, and we will only be able 
to use a tiny bit of its capability in this course.

In the code examples below a dollar sign $ represents the shell prompt.  This is to distinguish commands that you will 
input from their output. Do not type the $ when you run these commands yourself.

## Instructions
- Refactor your assignment 1 program by moving its functions into separate class files under the src/ directory. \
  - This program’s user interface should remain exactly the same as the previous assignment. Do not make any changes 
  here unless you had a mistake in the previous submission that you need to fix. \
- NOTE: Please modify your first program, if necessary, using fib(0) = 0 for the fibonacci calculations. \
- In the repository’s top-level directory create a Gradle build file called build.gradle. \
  - Compose your Gradle build file such that an executable JAR file is created as a part of the build process. This JAR 
  file will be named 'Assn2.jar`.

## Classes
To take full advantage of the Gradle build system your program will be split into multiple classes. Without Gradle 
compiling this project by hand is a bit of a hassle. With Gradle it is just as simple as building a single-class 
program. Each class in your solution is responsible for producing one type of output:
- src/Assn2.java - contains the main() method and is responsible for reading command-line arguments and dispatches work 
to other classes.
- src/E.java - Contains the function used to compute e with a Taylor series.
- src/Fac.java - Contains the function used to compute the Factorial of N.
- src/Fib.java - Contains the function used to compute the Nth Fibonacci number.
- src/Help.java - Contains a function which produces the “Usage” message that is given when the wrong arguments are 
given. Any other messages that your program produces should be generated by this class and NOT from src/Assn2.java.

## Managing the build with Gradle
build.gradle instructs the Gradle build tool on how to build and run your program. For the rest of the semester the 
graders will be using Gradle to test your assignments. Take enough time to test your build process to ensure they won’t 
run into any problems. You will be penalized if your assignment only works on your computer.

Below you will find a brief overview. Refer here for full instructions: Gradle Installation & Tutorial

## Running your program
Gradle can run your project from the command line as follows:

$ gradle run --args="-fib 0 -fib 30 -e 10 -fac 17" \
\> Task :run

Fibonacci of 0 is 0 \
Fibonacci of 30 is 832040 \
Value of e using 10 iterations is 2.7182815255731922 \
Factorial of 17 is 355687428096000 \

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 430ms 2 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 1 up-to-date \

Notice that the command-line arguments sent to your application are surrounded by double-quotes. The quoting is needed 
because the arguments for your program are first arguments to Gradle itself.

## Running the executable JAR
The Java ARchive (JAR) created by Gradle is placed in the path build/libs. It can be run by java using a command like 
the following:

$ java -jar build/libs/Assn2.jar -fib 0 -fib 39 -e 100 -fac 27 -fib 7

Fibonacci of 0 is 0 \
Fibonacci of 39 is 63245986 \
Value of e using 100 iterations is 2.7182818284590450 \
Factorial of 27 is 10888869450418352160768000000 \
Fibonacci of 7 is 13 \

Be aware that the name of the JAR file created by Gradle defaults to the name of directory containing the file 
build.gradle (in other words, the name of your project directory, so it will be something like Smith-Jane-Assn2).  This 
can be overridden by the archivesBaseName property.  See the Gradle Installation & Tutorial for more details.

## Testing
Ensure that this iteration of the project produces identical output to the previous version. Note that additional test 
cases will be used to grade your assignment.

$ gradle build \

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 537ms \
5 actionable tasks: 5 executed \

$ gradle run --args="-fib 0 -fib 20 -e 2 -fac 70 -e 20 -fib 39 -e 20" \

Fibonacci of 0 is 0 \
Fibonacci of 20 is 6765 \
Value of e using 2 iterations is 2.0000000000000000 \
Factorial of 70 is 11978571669969891796072783721689098736458938142546425857555362864628009582789845319680000000000000000 \

## Notes
Gradle tutorials you find online will advise you to generate build.gradle by running the gradle init command. This would 
be appropriate advice if you were

- Already an expert with Gradle
- Working on a very large project with more than a handful of files

Because neither of these conditions apply to you I strongly encourage you to stick with simple Gradle files in this 
course. Gradle is a big, complex system and we need only a fraction of its functionality; more than that becomes 
confusing at this early stage. Your primary goal is to learn what build systems are all about. All other considerations 
are a distant second. Additionally, any added complexity increases the possibility that your build fails on the grader’s 
computer.
- Refer to the Gradle Installation & Tutorial for details on installing Gradle and creating a Gradle build file
- Code must follow the course coding standard
